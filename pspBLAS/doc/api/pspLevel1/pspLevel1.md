# Overview

The `pspLevel1.F90` file defines the `pspLevel1` module, which is intended to encapsulate Level 1 routines for the pspBLAS library. Level 1 BLAS operations typically involve vector-vector operations such as dot products, vector norms (e.g., Euclidean norm), vector scaling (SAXPY), and vector copy.

However, in its current state as presented in the file, the `pspLevel1` module primarily sets up some fundamental parameters (double precision kind, complex constants) and includes a private error termination routine (`die`). It does not appear to contain the explicit implementations or public interfaces for any computational Level 1 BLAS routines. A commented-out line (`!public :: psp_sp2den_dm`) might suggest a function that was previously part of this module or is planned for future inclusion.

# Key Components

*   **Module `pspLevel1`**:
    *   Defines precision parameters:
        *   `dp`: An integer parameter set by `selected_real_kind(15,300)`, defining the double precision floating-point kind.
        *   `cmplx_1`, `cmplx_i`, `cmplx_0`: `COMPLEX(dp)` parameters representing (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0), and (0.0, 0.0) respectively.
    *   Declares `numroc` as an `EXTERNAL` function. This function is typically part of ScaLAPACK and is used to compute the number of rows or columns of a block-cyclically distributed matrix that a particular process would store.
    *   Contains a private `die` subroutine for error handling.

*   **Subroutine `die(message)`** (private):
    *   **Purpose**: Provides a standardized way to terminate program execution when a fatal error is encountered.
    *   **Behavior**: It opens a file named "MatrixSwitch.log" (appending if it already exists from a previous call in the same run, otherwise creating it). It writes a "FATAL ERROR in matrix_switch!" message, followed by the custom `message` passed to the subroutine. After writing to the log, it stops the program execution.
    *   *Note*: The log file name "MatrixSwitch.log" might indicate that pspBLAS shares logging infrastructure with another library named MatrixSwitch, or it could be a placeholder name.

# Important Variables/Constants

*   `dp`: The integer kind parameter for double precision. This ensures consistent floating-point precision for routines within this module and for data structures it might operate on (defined in `pspVariable`).
*   `cmplx_1`, `cmplx_i`, `cmplx_0`: Standard complex number constants.
*   `HAVE_CONFIG_H`: A preprocessor macro. If defined, it triggers the inclusion of a `config.h` file, typically used for project-wide build configurations.
*   `HAVE_MPI`: A preprocessor macro. If defined, the MPI Fortran header file `mpif.h` is included. This suggests that some Level 1 operations might be MPI-aware, or the module needs MPI definitions for other reasons (e.g., error reporting specific to an MPI rank via the `die` routine, though not currently implemented in the shown `die` code).

# Usage Examples

Given that no public computational Level 1 routines are defined or exposed in this specific file, direct usage examples of pspBLAS Level 1 operations cannot be derived from its content. The `die` subroutine is intended for internal error management.

If Level 1 routines were present, they would typically be used as follows (conceptual):
```fortran
USE pspLevel1
USE pspVariable ! Assuming vector types are defined here
TYPE(psp_vector) :: vec_x, vec_y
REAL(dp) :: dot_product_result, alpha

! ... initialize vec_x, vec_y, alpha ...

! Conceptual Level 1 calls
! dot_product_result = psp_ddot(vec_x, vec_y)
! CALL psp_daxpy(alpha, vec_x, vec_y) ! vec_y = alpha*vec_x + vec_y
```

# Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`pspVariable`**: The `USE pspVariable` statement indicates that this module relies on type definitions (e.g., for vectors or sparse matrix structures that Level 1 routines would operate on) and possibly constants defined in `pspVariable`.
*   **`pspUtility`**: The `USE pspUtility` statement suggests a dependency on helper functions or common tools provided by the `pspUtility` module.
*   **`pspMPI`**: The `USE pspMPI` statement implies that the Level 1 routines may be designed to work in a parallel MPI environment, or that `pspMPI` provides necessary setup/context.
*   **`mpif.h`**: This MPI header file is included if `HAVE_MPI` is defined, providing access to MPI constants, types, and subroutine interfaces.
*   **`numroc` (External Function)**: The declaration of `numroc` as external suggests that ScaLAPACK functionalities might be used, particularly for operations on distributed data structures, even at Level 1 (e.g., calculating local portions of vectors).

The `pspLevel1` module, in its current form, seems to be a foundational piece. The actual implementations of Level 1 BLAS operations are expected to be in other files that are part of the `pspLevel1` conceptual unit or are made accessible through the modules it `USE`s. The `die` routine provides a basic error handling mechanism.
