# Overview

The `psp_spBLAS_Level2.F90` file defines the `psp_spBLAS_Level2` module. This module is intended to be a part of the pspBLAS utility collection, specifically designated to house the core implementations or "Subroutine Subprogram Templates" (SST) for Level 2 sparse BLAS operations. Level 2 sparse BLAS operations typically involve computations between a sparse matrix and a dense vector. Common examples include:
*   Sparse matrix-dense vector multiplication (SpMV): `y := alpha*op(A)*x + beta*y`.
*   Solving a sparse triangular system with a dense vector: `op(T)*x = y`.

However, in its current state as presented in the `psp_spBLAS_Level2.F90` file, the module primarily consists of parameter definitions (for precision and complex numbers) and `USE` statements that import other pspBLAS modules. **It does not contain any explicit implementations or public interfaces for computational Level 2 sparse BLAS routines.**

# Key Components

*   **Module `psp_spBLAS_Level2`**:
    *   Defines standard precision parameters:
        *   `dp`: An integer parameter set by `selected_real_kind(15,300)`, defining the kind for double-precision floating-point numbers.
        *   `cmplx_1`, `cmplx_i`, `cmplx_0`: `COMPLEX(dp)` parameters representing (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0) (the imaginary unit), and (0.0, 0.0), respectively.
    *   Includes `USE` statements for other pspBLAS modules: `pspVariable`, `pspBasicTool`, `pspListTool`, and `psp_spBLAS_Level1`. This indicates that any Level 2 routines implemented here would likely leverage data structures and utilities from these foundational modules.

# Important Variables/Constants

*   `dp`: The integer kind parameter for double precision.
*   `cmplx_1`, `cmplx_i`, `cmplx_0`: Standard complex number constants.
*   `HAVE_CONFIG_H`: A preprocessor macro. If defined, it includes a `config.h` file, typically used for project-wide build configurations.
*   `HAVE_MPI`: A preprocessor macro. If defined, the MPI Fortran header file `mpif.h` is included. This suggests that some Level 2 sparse BLAS kernels might be designed for MPI-parallel environments or require MPI context.

# Usage Examples

Given that no public computational Level 2 sparse BLAS routines are defined or exposed in this specific file, direct usage examples cannot be derived from its content.

If Level 2 SST routines were present (e.g., a kernel for sparse matrix-vector multiplication like `psp_sst_csrmv` for a matrix in CSR format), they would typically be called by higher-level pspBLAS interface routines found in the `pspLevel2` module. For example:

```fortran
! Conceptual usage if psp_sst_csrmv was defined here:
! MODULE some_higher_level_routine
!   USE psp_spBLAS_Level2 ! To get access to psp_sst_csrmv
!   USE pspVariable       ! For matrix/vector type definitions
!   IMPLICIT NONE
! CONTAINS
!   SUBROUTINE my_sparse_mv_wrapper(alpha, A_sparse, x_dense, beta, y_dense)
!     TYPE(psp_matrix_spm), INTENT(IN) :: A_sparse
!     REAL(dp), INTENT(IN) :: x_dense(:), alpha, beta
!     REAL(dp), INTENT(INOUT) :: y_dense(:)
!
!     ! Assuming A_sparse is in CSR format and its components are accessible
!     ! CALL psp_sst_csrmv(A_sparse%num_rows, A_sparse%num_cols, alpha, &
!     !                      A_sparse%values, A_sparse%col_indices, A_sparse%row_pointers, &
!     !                      x_dense, beta, y_dense)
!   END SUBROUTINE my_sparse_mv_wrapper
! END MODULE some_higher_level_routine
```

# Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`pspVariable`**: The `USE pspVariable` statement indicates an expected dependency on data structures (like `TYPE(psp_matrix_spm)` for sparse matrices and potentially types for dense vectors if not using raw arrays) and constants defined in `pspVariable`.
*   **`pspBasicTool`**: The `USE pspBasicTool` statement suggests that Level 2 kernels might rely on utilities for format conversion, index manipulation, or other basic operations provided by `pspBasicTool`.
*   **`pspListTool`**: The `USE pspListTool` statement implies that linked list functionalities might be used, perhaps in specialized Level 2 routines that involve dynamic construction or modification of sparse structures, though this is less common for typical SpMV or TRSV operations.
*   **`psp_spBLAS_Level1`**: The `USE psp_spBLAS_Level1` statement indicates that Level 2 sparse BLAS operations could potentially be built upon Level 1 sparse vector operations (e.g., using dot products in the context of a matrix-vector multiply).
*   **`mpif.h`**: This MPI header file is included if `HAVE_MPI` is defined. This allows for the possibility that Level 2 sparse BLAS kernels could be MPI-parallelized or require access to MPI context information.

The `psp_spBLAS_Level2` module, in its current state in this file, serves as a placeholder or a foundational piece. The actual implementations of Level 2 sparse BLAS computational kernels are expected to be located in other source files or would be added to this module if it were to be further developed with these specific routines.
