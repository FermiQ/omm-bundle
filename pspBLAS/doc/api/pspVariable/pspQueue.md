# Overview

The `pspQueue.F90` file defines the `pspQueue` module, which is intended to provide queue data structures within the pspBLAS library. These queues appear to be designed to store sparse matrix elements, as the node types (`psp_dLnkNode` and `psp_zLnkNode`) include fields for row index, column index, and a numerical value. A queue is a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

The module defines derived types for the queue nodes (for real and complex data) and for the queue itself, which essentially holds a pointer to the first node and the length of the queue. It provides interfaces and initial subroutines for queue initialization and an attempt at deallocation.

**However, the implementation of the queue operations, particularly deallocation, appears to be incomplete or incorrect in the provided code. Additionally, standard queue operations like enqueue (add to rear) and dequeue (remove from front) are not defined in this file.**

# Key Components

*   **Module `pspQueue`**:
    *   **Derived Types**:
        *   `psp_dLnkNode`: Defines a node for a queue of real-valued sparse elements.
            *   `rowidx`: `INTEGER`, row index of the element.
            *   `colidx`: `INTEGER`, column index of the element.
            *   `val`: `REAL(dp)`, the real value of the element.
            *   `next`: `TYPE(psp_dLnkNode), POINTER`, pointer to the next node in the queue.
        *   `psp_zLnkNode`: Defines a node for a queue of complex-valued sparse elements.
            *   `rowidx`: `INTEGER`, row index.
            *   `colidx`: `INTEGER`, column index.
            *   `val`: `COMPLEX(dp)`, the complex value.
            *   `next`: `TYPE(psp_dLnkNode), POINTER`. **Potential Bug**: This should likely be `TYPE(psp_zLnkNode), POINTER` to correctly link complex nodes.
        *   `psp_dQueue`: Represents a queue of real sparse elements.
            *   `first`: `TYPE(psp_dLnkNode), POINTER`, pointer to the first node in the queue.
            *   `length`: `INTEGER`, the number of elements currently in the queue.
            *   `is_initialized`: `LOGICAL` (defaults to `.FALSE.`), flag to indicate if the queue has been initialized.
        *   `psp_zQueue`: Represents a queue of complex sparse elements.
            *   `first`: `TYPE(psp_zLnkNode), POINTER`, pointer to the first node.
            *   `length`: `INTEGER`.
            *   `is_initialized`: `LOGICAL` (defaults to `.FALSE.`).

    *   **Public Interfaces and Subroutines**:
        *   `psp_queue_init`: Interface for initializing a queue.
            *   `psp_dqueue_init(q_name, val)`: Initializes a `psp_dQueue` `q_name`. It allocates a single `psp_dLnkNode`, sets its `val` component to the input `val` (row and column indices are not set by this routine), points `q_name%first` to this node, and sets `q_name%length` to 1 and `is_initialized` to `.TRUE.`.
            *   `psp_zqueue_init(q_name, val)`: Similar initialization for a `psp_zQueue`.
        *   `psp_queue_deallocate`: Interface intended for deallocating a queue.
            *   `psp_dqueue_deallocate(q_name)`: **This subroutine appears to be incorrectly implemented.** It uses local variables `node` and `m_name` that are not properly initialized or connected to the input `q_name`. It does not loop through the queue to deallocate each node and will not correctly free memory, likely leading to errors or memory leaks.
            *   The complex version, `psp_zqueue_deallocate`, is declared in the interface but **missing from the module's `CONTAINS` section**.
    *   **Erroneous Public Exports**: The module also incorrectly lists `psp_matrix_spm`, `psp_register_spm`, and `psp_deallocate_spm` in its `PUBLIC` statement. These entities belong to the `pspMat` module and are not defined or used within `pspQueue`.

# Important Variables/Constants

*   `dp`: Integer parameter for double precision kind (`selected_real_kind(15,300)`).
*   `cmplx_1, cmplx_i, cmplx_0`: Standard complex constants of kind `dp`.

# Usage Examples

Given the incomplete and potentially buggy state of the deallocation routines and the lack of core queue operations (enqueue, dequeue), robust usage of this module as a general-purpose queue is not advisable.

A conceptual example for the initialization part:
```fortran
USE pspQueue
IMPLICIT NONE

TYPE(psp_dQueue) :: my_real_data_queue
REAL(dp)         :: first_value

first_value = 42.0_dp
CALL psp_queue_init(my_real_data_queue, first_value)

IF (my_real_data_queue%is_initialized) THEN
  PRINT *, "Queue initialized, length:", my_real_data_queue%length
  IF (ASSOCIATED(my_real_data_queue%first)) THEN
    PRINT *, "First element value:", my_real_data_queue%first%val
    ! Note: rowidx and colidx of this first node are undefined by psp_dqueue_init
  END IF
END IF

! Attempting to deallocate would be problematic with the current implementation
! CALL psp_queue_deallocate(my_real_data_queue)
```

# Dependencies and Interactions

*   This module is largely self-contained for its type definitions, using only intrinsic Fortran types and parameters defined locally.
*   It does not explicitly `USE` other pspBLAS modules like `pspVariable` in the provided snippet, but it's intended to be part of that collection. The `dp` parameter definition is repeated here.
*   **Potential Bug**: The `next` pointer in `psp_zLnkNode` is typed as `psp_dLnkNode` instead of `psp_zLnkNode`.
*   **Missing/Flawed Functionality**:
    *   The deallocation routine `psp_dqueue_deallocate` is incorrectly implemented.
    *   The deallocation routine for complex queues (`psp_zqueue_deallocate`) is missing.
    *   Essential queue operations like `enqueue` (add an element to the rear), `dequeue` (remove an element from the front), `peek` (view the front element), and `isEmpty` are not provided.
*   The erroneous public exports of `psp_matrix_spm` related routines should be removed.

In its current state, this `pspQueue` module provides a very rudimentary and incomplete foundation for queue data structures. It requires significant corrections and additions to be practically useful.
