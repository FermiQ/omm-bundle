# Overview

The `pspSpmSpm_tt.F90` file provides the `pspSpmSpm_tt` module, intended as a component of the pspBLAS Level 3 library. This module is designated for handling sparse matrix-sparse matrix multiplications where both input sparse matrices, `A` and `B`, are to be used in their transposed (or conjugate-transposed) forms. The target operation is `C := alpha*op(A)*op(B) + beta*C`, where `op(A) = A^T` or `A^H`, and `op(B) = B^T` or `B^H`. All matrices `A, B, C` are sparse and of `TYPE(psp_matrix_spm)`.

**Important Note:** The current version of the subroutines `psp_dgespmspm_tt` and `psp_zgespmspm_tt` within this module only includes initial setup like argument declarations and retrieval of BLACS grid information. **The core computational logic for performing the transposed sparse - transposed sparse matrix multiplication is missing and thus not implemented.**

# Key Components

*   **Module `pspSpmSpm_tt`**:
    *   **Public Interface `psp_gespmspm_tt`**: This interface is intended to expose the routines for transposed-sparse times transposed-sparse multiplication.
        *   `psp_dgespmspm_tt(M,N,K,A,opA,B,opB,C,alpha,beta)`: Real double precision version (currently not implemented).
        *   `psp_zgespmspm_tt(M,N,K,A,opA,B,opB,C,alpha,beta)`: Complex double precision version (currently not implemented).
        *   **Arguments (as intended)**:
            *   `M, N, K`: Integers representing global dimensions. Sparse matrix `A` is K-by-M (so `op(A)` is M-by-K). Sparse matrix `B` is N-by-K (so `op(B)` is K-by-N). The resulting sparse matrix `C` would be M-by-N. All are of `TYPE(psp_matrix_spm)`.
            *   `A, B`: `TYPE(psp_matrix_spm)` (inout). Input sparse matrices.
            *   `opA, opB`: Character flags, which for this module should be 'T' (transpose) or 'C' (conjugate transpose).
            *   `C`: `TYPE(psp_matrix_spm)` (inout). The output sparse matrix.
            *   `alpha, beta`: Scalar multipliers (real or complex).
        *   **Functionality**: The subroutines currently only retrieve BLACS grid information using `blacs_gridinfo`. The subsequent steps of the SUMMA algorithm or any other multiplication logic (panel extraction, broadcast, local multiplication, result assembly) are absent.

    *   **Subroutine `die(message)`** (private): Standard error handling routine that writes to "MatrixSwitch.log" and stops execution.

# Important Variables/Constants

*   `dp`: Integer parameter for double precision kind.
*   `cmplx_1, cmplx_i, cmplx_0`: Standard complex constants of kind `dp`.
*   **COMMON Block `/psp_grid2D/`**: Contains essential parameters for distributed algorithms (BLACS context, grid dimensions, MPI communicators, block sizes), which would be used if the implementation were complete.
*   `numroc`: Declared as an `EXTERNAL` function (typically from ScaLAPACK).
*   Local variables for grid information (`iprow`, `ipcol`, `nprow`, `npcol`) are declared and populated. Other local variables for matrix dimensions and temporary storage are declared but mostly unused.

# Usage Examples

The `psp_dgespmspm_tt` and `psp_zgespmspm_tt` subroutines are intended to be called by the higher-level dispatcher routines (`psp_dgespmspm`, `psp_zgespmspm`) in the `pspSpmSpm` module when both `opA` and `opB` arguments indicate a transpose operation.

**However, due to the missing implementation, calling these routines will not produce the correct mathematical result.** A conceptual call (if implemented) would follow the pattern described in the `pspSpmSpm.md` documentation.

# Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`pspVariable`**: Essential for the `TYPE(psp_matrix_spm)` definition.
*   **`pspUtility`**: Included via `USE`, but no specific utilities from it are actively used in the current state of `_tt` routines beyond what might be generally available.
*   **`pspMPI`**: Depends on the initialized common block `/psp_grid2D/`.
*   **`pspLevel1`, `pspLevel2`, `pspMatSum`**: These modules are `USE`d but their functionalities are not invoked in this file.
*   **MPI Library**: `mpif.h` is included if `HAVE_MPI` is defined. No direct MPI calls are made in the current routines, but a full implementation would require them.
*   **BLACS Library**: `blacs_gridinfo` is called to get process grid information.
*   The module, as it stands, is a stub for the "transpose-transpose" case of sparse matrix-sparse matrix multiplication. A complete implementation would require a complex parallel algorithm, potentially involving on-the-fly transposition of sparse matrix panels or a specialized kernel for `op(A)_panel * op(B)_panel`, along with mechanisms for distributing data and assembling the sparse result matrix `C`.
