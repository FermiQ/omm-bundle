# Overview

The `pspLevel2.F90` file defines the `pspLevel2` module, which is designated to house Level 2 Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) for the pspBLAS library. Level 2 BLAS operations are characterized by matrix-vector computations. Common examples include:
*   GEMV (General Matrix-Vector Multiply): `y = alpha*A*x + beta*y`
*   TRMV (Triangular Matrix-Vector Multiply): `x = op(T)*x`
*   TRSV (Triangular Solver for a Vector): Solves `op(T)*x = b` for `x`.
*   GER (General Rank-1 Update): `A = alpha*x*y^T + A`

However, the current content of the `pspLevel2.F90` file shows that the module primarily sets up basic parameters (like precision kinds and complex constants) and includes a private error termination routine (`die`). There are no explicit implementations or public interfaces for any computational Level 2 BLAS routines within this specific file.

# Key Components

*   **Module `pspLevel2`**:
    *   Defines precision-related parameters:
        *   `dp`: An integer parameter set by `selected_real_kind(15,300)`, establishing the kind for double-precision floating-point numbers.
        *   `cmplx_1`, `cmplx_i`, `cmplx_0`: `COMPLEX(dp)` parameters representing (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0) (the imaginary unit), and (0.0, 0.0), respectively.
    *   Declares `numroc` as an `EXTERNAL` function. `numroc` is a utility function from ScaLAPACK used to determine the number of rows or columns of a block-cyclically distributed matrix that are stored on a specific process.
    *   Contains a private `die` subroutine for error handling and program termination.

*   **Subroutine `die(message)`** (private):
    *   **Purpose**: Provides a standardized mechanism for halting program execution upon encountering a fatal error.
    *   **Behavior**: This routine opens a file named "MatrixSwitch.log" (it appends if the file exists from a prior call in the same execution, otherwise, it creates a new file). It then writes the message "FATAL ERROR in matrix_switch!" followed by the specific error `message` (passed as an argument) to this log file. Finally, it terminates the program execution using `STOP`.
    *   *Note*: The log file name "MatrixSwitch.log" is identical to that in `pspLevel1.F90`, potentially indicating shared logging infrastructure or a naming convention inherited from a related project (MatrixSwitch).

# Important Variables/Constants

*   `dp`: The integer kind parameter for double precision, ensuring consistent floating-point arithmetic.
*   `cmplx_1`, `cmplx_i`, `cmplx_0`: Standard complex number constants derived from `dp`.
*   `HAVE_CONFIG_H`: A preprocessor macro. If defined during compilation, it includes a `config.h` file, which is typically used for managing project-wide build options and preprocessor definitions.
*   `HAVE_MPI`: A preprocessor macro. If defined, the MPI (Message Passing Interface) Fortran header file `mpif.h` is included. This suggests that Level 2 operations within pspBLAS may be designed for or require an MPI parallel environment.

# Usage Examples

As no public computational Level 2 routines are defined or exposed in this particular file, direct usage examples of pspBLAS Level 2 operations cannot be provided from its content. The `die` subroutine is intended for internal error management within the library.

If Level 2 routines (e.g., a general matrix-vector product) were present, their usage might look conceptually like this:

```fortran
USE pspLevel2
USE pspVariable      ! Assuming psp_matrix and psp_vector types are defined here
IMPLICIT NONE

TYPE(psp_matrix) :: matrix_A
TYPE(psp_vector) :: vector_x, vector_y
REAL(dp)         :: alpha, beta

! ... Code to initialize matrix_A, vector_x, vector_y, alpha, beta ...

! Conceptual call to a hypothetical pspBLAS Level 2 routine
! CALL psp_dgemv(transpose_flag, alpha, matrix_A, vector_x, beta, vector_y)
! This would compute y = alpha * op(A) * x + beta * y
```

# Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`pspVariable`**: The `USE pspVariable` statement indicates that the `pspLevel2` module relies on data structure definitions (e.g., for matrices and vectors) and possibly constants provided by `pspVariable`.
*   **`pspUtility`**: The `USE pspUtility` statement suggests a dependency on utility functions or common tools available in the `pspUtility` module.
*   **`pspMPI`**: The `USE pspMPI` statement implies that Level 2 operations might be designed for parallel execution using MPI, or that `pspMPI` provides necessary communication or context.
*   **`pspLevel1`**: The `USE pspLevel1` statement indicates that Level 2 routines could potentially build upon or utilize functionalities provided by the Level 1 module (e.g., vector scaling or dot products as part of a more complex operation).
*   **`mpif.h`**: This MPI header file is included if `HAVE_MPI` is defined, giving access to MPI constants, derived types, and subroutine interfaces. This is essential for any direct MPI calls within the Level 2 routines.
*   **`numroc` (External Function)**: The declaration of `numroc` points to the use of ScaLAPACK-style distributed data layouts, suggesting that the pspBLAS Level 2 routines are intended to operate on matrices and vectors distributed across multiple processes.

Currently, the `pspLevel2.F90` file serves as a foundational framework. The actual implementations of the pspBLAS Level 2 computational routines are expected to be located in other source files or made available through the modules it `USE`s. The existing `die` routine offers a basic error handling capability.
